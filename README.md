## **Replaced by [find_sp2x_patches](https://github.com/akitakedits/find_sp2x_patches), a more robust script making use of signature matching.**

## About

Python script to automatically port as many Spice2x patches as possible from one game version to another.

## Requirements

- Install **python 3.6 or newer** *(according to [vermin](https://github.com/netromdk/vermin))*
- Clone the repo and go to its root directory `git clone https://github.com/akitakedits/port_sp2x_patches.git && cd port_sp2x_patches`

## Technique & Limitations

The script iterates through each patch attempting to find its default hex data in the new dll.  
It tries to find slices\* of said data in the new dll, lowering its margin\* value with each iteration.  
This allows for precision to be maximized, avoiding false positives as much as possible.  
The script stops iterating once only **one** occurence of the slice is found in the new dll, then **assumes** that's the new offset for that patch.  

\**slice: the bytes modified by the patch PLUS a margin.*  
\**margin: the amount of bytes added on either side of the patch's data for matching purposes.*

- **False positive may occur, don't trust the script will do a perfect job every time**.
- Only accepts Memory and Union type patches.
- Union type patches are only compatible if all sub-patches modify bytes at the same offset.
- Union type patches are only compatible if all sub-patches modify the same amount of bytes.

## Usage

`python port_sp2x_patches.py <game_code> <old_dll> <new_dll>`

### Arguments

- `game_code` - The game code (KFC, LDJ, etc..) corresponding to your dll files, not case sensitive.
- `old_dll` - The path to the game's dll you want to port patches **from**. **Must be an unpatched dll.**
- `new_dll` - The path to the game's dll you want to port patches **to**. **Must be an unpatched dll.**

**Requires** the `.json` file containing patches for your `old_dll` in the same directory as the script.  
**It must be be named properly**, matching the PE Identifier and game code for its dll.  

### Example

#### File tree
> port_sp2x_patches/  
> ├─ KFC-6643ed55_663968.json *(patches for soundvoltex_old.dll)*  
> ├─ port_sp2x_patches.py  
> ├─ soundvoltex_new.dll  
> ├─ soundvoltex_old.dll  

#### Command and Output
```
> python port_sp2x_patches.py kfc soundvoltex_old.dll soundvoltex_new.dll
